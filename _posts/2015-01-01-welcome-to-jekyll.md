During the initial discussion with their thesis advisor, Professor Yang, students Huang Kunwei, Zhang Jieming, and Ju Hanqi clarified their goals for their graduation design project, which is to delve into the foundational knowledge of mechanics, including courses such as mechanical design, principles of mechanics, theoretical mechanics, and materials mechanics. Professor Yang recommended professional software tools including SolidWorks (version 2020), CAXA (version 2020), ANSYS (version 17.0), and ADAMS (version 2018), and invited the students to his office to copy these resources. Additionally, the meeting included a preliminary discussion on the ideas for the graduation project's proposal, laying a solid foundation for the smooth progress of the project.
